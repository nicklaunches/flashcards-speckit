# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5+ with React 18+ and Next.js 14+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Next.js, Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: SQLite (local database only - offline-first requirement)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit tests), Playwright (smoke tests for critical journeys)
**Target Platform**: Web (modern browsers), static export capable
**Project Type**: Web application (single-page app with Next.js)
**Performance Goals**: First Load JS <160KB, FCP <1.5s on 3G, Core Web Vitals "Good"
**Constraints**: WCAG AA compliance, offline-first (no external services), local-only operation
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., number of flashcard decks, concurrent study sessions or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Vertical Slicing**: All planned tasks can be completed in <30 minutes
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Uses React + Next.js + TypeScript + SQLite/Drizzle only
- [ ] **Test Strategy**: Unit tests planned for core logic, Playwright for user journeys
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: First Load JS bundle projected to stay <160KB
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance strategy documented
- [ ] **Offline-First**: No external dependencies or network requirements identified

```

**Structure Decision**: Next.js application with App Router, following offline-first principle with all dependencies bundled locally.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
