# Feature Specification: Offline-First Flashcards Study App

**Feature Branch**: `001-flashcards-app`
**Created**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a local, offline-first Flashcards app for quick study sessions"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Study Decks (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I can create decks with names and descriptions to organize my study materials by topic or subject. This allows me to structure my learning and focus on specific areas.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the app - without the ability to create and organize decks, no other functionality can exist.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a deck with a name and description, verifying it persists between app sessions, and delivers immediate organizational value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the main screen, **When** I click "Create New Deck", **Then** I see a form to enter deck name and description
2. **Given** I enter a deck name and description, **When** I save the deck, **Then** the deck appears in my deck list and persists after app restart
3. **Given** I have existing decks, **When** I edit a deck's name or description, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
4. **Given** I have a deck with cards, **When** I delete the deck, **Then** the deck and all its cards are removed permanently

---

### User Story 2 - Add and Edit Flashcards (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I can add flashcards with front and back content to my decks, and edit them as my understanding evolves. This lets me capture and refine the knowledge I want to study.

**Why this priority**: Cards are the core content of the app - without the ability to create and manage cards, there's nothing to study.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding cards to a deck, editing their content, and verifying the changes persist independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a deck, **When** I click "Add Card", **Then** I see a form with front and back text fields
2. **Given** I enter front and back content, **When** I save the card, **Then** the card is added to the deck and appears in the card list
3. **Given** I have existing cards, **When** I edit a card's front or back content, **Then** the changes are saved immediately
4. **Given** I have cards in a deck, **When** I delete a card, **Then** it is removed from the deck permanently

---

### User Story 3 - Study Deck with Quiz Flow (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I can study a deck through a quiz interface that shows the front of a card, lets me flip to see the answer, and mark my confidence level. This provides the core study experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value proposition - the actual studying functionality that makes the app useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a study session, going through cards, marking difficulty levels, and seeing progress tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a deck with cards, **When** I click "Study Deck", **Then** I see the first card's front side
2. **Given** I am viewing a card's front, **When** I click "Flip" or press Space, **Then** I see the card's back side
3. **Given** I am viewing a card's back, **When** I mark it as "Easy" or "Hard", **Then** the next card appears
4. **Given** I am studying, **When** I complete all cards, **Then** I see a summary with accuracy and progress stats

---

### User Story 4 - Spaced Repetition System (Priority: P2)

As a learner, cards I mark as "Hard" appear more frequently in future study sessions, while "Easy" cards appear less often. This optimizes my study time by focusing on challenging material.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the learning effectiveness but requires the basic study flow to exist first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by marking cards with different difficulty levels and verifying they appear with appropriate frequency in subsequent study sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I mark cards as "Hard" during study, **When** I start a new study session, **Then** those cards appear more frequently
2. **Given** I mark cards as "Easy" repeatedly, **When** I study the deck again, **Then** those cards appear less frequently
3. **Given** I haven't studied a deck recently, **When** I start studying, **Then** cards due for review are prioritized
4. **Given** I consistently mark a card as "Easy", **When** enough time passes, **Then** the card eventually appears again for reinforcement

---

### User Story 5 - Search and Filter (Priority: P2)

As a learner, I can search through my decks and cards by text content to quickly find specific information or review related concepts.

**Why this priority**: This improves usability and helps with large collections but isn't essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple decks and cards, then searching for specific terms and verifying relevant results appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple decks, **When** I enter text in the search box, **Then** I see decks whose names or descriptions match
2. **Given** I have cards with various content, **When** I search for specific terms, **Then** I see cards containing those terms on front or back
3. **Given** I am viewing search results, **When** I click on a result, **Then** I navigate to that deck or card
4. **Given** I clear the search, **When** the search box is empty, **Then** I see all my decks and cards again

---

### User Story 6 - Keyboard Navigation and Shortcuts (Priority: P3)

As a learner, I can use keyboard shortcuts (J/K for navigation, Space for flip) to study efficiently without reaching for the mouse, enabling faster study sessions.

**Why this priority**: This is a quality-of-life improvement that enhances the user experience but isn't essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using only keyboard controls to navigate through study sessions and verify all actions work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am studying a deck, **When** I press Space, **Then** the card flips or advances to next card
2. **Given** I am viewing card options, **When** I press J or K, **Then** I can navigate between Easy/Hard choices
3. **Given** I am on any screen, **When** I press Escape, **Then** I return to the previous screen
4. **Given** I am in the main interface, **When** I press designated shortcuts, **Then** I can quickly access create, study, and search functions

---

### User Story 7 - Responsive Design and Dark Mode (Priority: P3)

As a learner, I can use the app comfortably on both desktop and mobile devices, and switch to dark mode for studying in low-light conditions.

**Why this priority**: This improves accessibility and usability across devices but doesn't affect core learning functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the app on different screen sizes and toggling dark mode to verify layout and readability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I access the app on mobile, **When** I use touch gestures, **Then** all functions work equivalently to desktop clicks
2. **Given** I am on any screen, **When** I toggle dark mode, **Then** the interface switches to dark theme with appropriate contrast
3. **Given** I resize my browser window, **When** the width changes, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately
4. **Given** I am studying on mobile, **When** I use swipe gestures, **Then** I can flip cards and navigate efficiently

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a deck has no cards and user tries to study it?
- How does the system handle very long card content that exceeds screen space?
- What occurs when search returns no results?
- How does spaced repetition behave when user marks all cards the same difficulty?
- What happens when local storage is full or corrupted?
- How does the app handle offline usage when user tries to sync (if applicable)?
- What occurs when user deletes a deck while in the middle of studying it?

## Assumptions

- Users primarily study alone (no collaboration features required)
- Text-only cards are sufficient (no images, audio, or rich formatting needed initially)
- Browser local storage provides adequate data persistence for typical use cases
- Standard spaced repetition intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month) are appropriate
- Users prefer immediate feedback over complex analytics
- No user authentication required since app is single-user and offline-first
- Standard web accessibility practices will be sufficient for initial release
