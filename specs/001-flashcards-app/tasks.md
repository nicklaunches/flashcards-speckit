# Tasks: Offline-First Flashcards Study App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-flashcards-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification, so no test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**‚ö†Ô∏è TASK SIZE CONSTRAINT**: Per constitution, 90% of tasks MUST complete in under 30 minutes. If a task description suggests >30min work, break it down into smaller, specific sub-tasks.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js structure**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/db/`, `public/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 & US2 for deck/card data
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 3 completion - Enhances study functionality
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable search feature
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Depends on User Stories 1-3 - Enhances navigation across existing functionality
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable UI enhancements

### Within Each User Story

- Repository classes before server actions
- Server actions before components
- Base components before page integration
- Core functionality before enhancement features

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 2, 5, 7 can start in parallel
- User Story 3 can start after US1 & US2 basic structure is complete
- All tasks within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all repository and server actions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Deck repository class with CRUD operations in src/lib/db/deck-repository.ts"
Task: "Implement createDeck Server Action in src/app/actions/deck.ts"
Task: "Implement updateDeck Server Action in src/app/actions/deck.ts"
Task: "Implement deleteDeck Server Action in src/app/actions/deck.ts"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DeckCard component for deck display in src/components/deck/deck-card.tsx"
Task: "Create DeckForm component for deck creation/editing in src/components/deck/deck-form.tsx"
Task: "Create DeckList component for displaying all decks in src/components/deck/deck-list.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Deck Management)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Card Management)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Study Interface)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test complete study workflow independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic deck management)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Card management)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP complete!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Smart studying)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Search feature)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Keyboard shortcuts)
8. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full UI polish)
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Deck Management)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Card Management)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Search) or User Story 7 (UI Polish)
3. After US1 & US2 complete:
   - Continue with User Story 3 (Study Interface)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Stories 1-3 form the complete MVP
- User Stories 4-7 are enhancements that add significant value
- Focus on vertical slices: complete one story before moving to next
